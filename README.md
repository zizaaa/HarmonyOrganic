This is my award-winning mini project 1 that I developed during a bootcamp. Originally, it started as a front-end project, skillfully crafted using Bootstrap and React. However, I have ambitious plans to take it to the next level by incorporating a robust database and implementing powerful backend functionalities. Through this project, I have honed my skills in web development, design, and user experience. It brings me immense joy to share my passion for creating innovative solutions. Being recognized as the 'Best in Mini Project 1 during the bootcamp' has further motivated me to continue pushing the boundaries of my abilities and aspiring for excellence in all my future endeavors.
